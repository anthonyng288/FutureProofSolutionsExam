# Future Proof Solutions Technical Test

Welcome to the **Future Proof Solutions Technical Test** project. This project demonstrates the use of Vue.js and Axios to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. Below are instructions on how to set up and view the project on your local machine.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
- Basic knowledge of navigating files and folders on your computer
- An internet connection to load external libraries via CDNs

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to view the project:

### 1. **Download or Clone the Repository**

- **Option 1:** Download the ZIP file:

  1. Click the green **Code** button on the repository page.
  2. Select **Download ZIP**.
  3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

- **Option 2:** Clone the repository (if you are familiar with Git):
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  ```
  Replace <repository-url> with the URL of the GitHub repository.

### 2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**

Using your file explorer or terminal, navigate to the folder where you downloaded or cloned the project.

### 3. **Open the Project**

Locate the `index.html`

- Non-Technical Users:
  - Double-click on the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.
- Technical Users:

  - You can use a local development server for better performance. For example:

    1. Install `http-server` globally if you have Node.js installed:
       ```bash
       npm install -g http-server
       ```
    2. Start the server in the project folder (Note make sure you are in the root directory of the project):
       ```bash
       http-server
       ```
    3. Open the provided URL (e.g `http://127.0.0.1:8080`)

### 4. **Interacting with the Application**

Once the project is loaded in your browser:

- You can explore the Method Selector, view method details, and navigate between different steps.

- All functionality is dynamic and fetches data using external APIs.

### **Technologies Used**

- Vue.js (via CDN): For creating reactive UI components.
- Axios (via CDN): For handling API requests.
- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the user interface.

### **Troubleshooting**

If you encounter issues:

- Ensure your browser supports modern JavaScript features.
- Check your internet connection to load external libraries and APIs.
